# Track Selection for Decision Flow Builder

## Recommended Track: **App for Business Teams**

### Why This Track is the Best Fit

**Decision Flow Builder is fundamentally a business productivity tool** that solves universal workflow challenges across all types of organizations. Here's why it belongs in the Business Teams track:

---

### 1. **Horizontal Application Across Business Functions**

The app addresses common business needs that span multiple departments:

- **IT/Support Teams**: Ticket triage, incident response workflows
- **HR Teams**: Onboarding checklists, approval routing
- **Product Teams**: Feature request intake, bug prioritization
- **Operations Teams**: Process standardization, compliance workflows
- **Sales Teams**: Lead qualification, deal routing

This **cross-functional applicability** is the hallmark of a business team app, not a specialized industry solution.

---

### 2. **Solves Universal Business Problems**

The core problems it addresses are universal to business teams:

- **Decision-making guidance**: Helping users navigate complex conditional logic
- **Process automation**: Reducing manual, repetitive tasks
- **Knowledge capture**: Encoding institutional knowledge into reusable workflows
- **Consistency**: Ensuring everyone follows the same process
- **Audit trails**: Tracking what happened and why

These aren't industry-specific challenges—they're fundamental business operations issues.

---

### 3. **No Industry-Specific Features**

Unlike specialized industry apps, Decision Flow Builder doesn't include:

- Healthcare-specific compliance (HIPAA workflows)
- Financial services regulations (SOX, KYC processes)
- Manufacturing-specific features (supply chain, quality control)
- Legal-specific workflows (case management, e-discovery)
- Education-specific features (student management, grading)

The app is **industry-agnostic by design**—it provides building blocks that any business team can configure for their needs.

---

### 4. **Targets Business Admins, Not Technical Specialists**

The primary user persona is:

- **Jira administrators** (often business analysts or team leads)
- **Process owners** who understand workflows but may not code
- **Team leads** who want to standardize their team's processes

This is a **business user tool**, not a developer tool or industry specialist tool. The visual, no-code interface reinforces this positioning.

---

### 5. **Enhances Core Business Collaboration**

The app enhances how business teams use Jira for:

- **Collaboration**: Guiding team members through shared processes
- **Communication**: Reducing back-and-forth questions about "what to do next"
- **Productivity**: Automating routine decisions and actions
- **Transparency**: Providing visibility into process execution

These are core business team productivity goals.

---

### Why NOT "App for Specialized Industries"?

The Specialized Industries track would be appropriate if the app:

- **Solved industry-specific problems**: e.g., "Healthcare Patient Intake Flow" or "Financial Compliance Workflow Builder"
- **Required domain expertise**: Users need specialized knowledge to use it effectively
- **Had industry-specific integrations**: Connected to EMR systems, trading platforms, manufacturing equipment, etc.
- **Addressed regulatory requirements**: Built-in HIPAA, GDPR, SOX compliance features
- **Used industry terminology**: Healthcare, legal, financial, or manufacturing-specific language

Decision Flow Builder does **none of these**. It's a general-purpose workflow tool that happens to be useful in many industries, but isn't specialized for any particular one.

---

### Competitive Positioning

In the Business Teams track, Decision Flow Builder competes with:

- **Jira Automation** (but offers visual decision trees instead of rule-based automation)
- **Workflow extensions** (but focuses on user guidance, not just backend automation)
- **Form builders** (but adds conditional logic and automated actions)

This positioning highlights its unique value: **combining user guidance with automation through visual workflows**.

---

### Summary

**Choose "App for Business Teams"** because Decision Flow Builder:

1. ✅ Solves universal business workflow challenges
2. ✅ Works across all departments and industries
3. ✅ Targets business users (admins, team leads), not specialists
4. ✅ Enhances core business collaboration and productivity
5. ✅ Requires no industry-specific knowledge to use
6. ✅ Provides horizontal value across the entire organization

It's a **business productivity multiplier**, not an industry-specific solution.
